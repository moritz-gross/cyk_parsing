# CYK Algorithm Implementation

## What is the CYK Algorithm?

The **CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm** is a dynamic programming algorithm used to determine whether a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Named after its inventors John Cocke, Daniel Younger, and Tadao Kasami, the algorithm works by building a parse table bottom-up, starting with individual characters and progressively combining them to check if larger substrings can be derived from the grammar's non-terminal symbols. With a time complexity of O(n³|G|), where n is the length of the input string and |G| is the size of the grammar, CYK is one of the most efficient algorithms for parsing context-free languages and is widely used in computational linguistics, compiler design, and natural language processing.
